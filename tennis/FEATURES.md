# Tennis Radar — Features

Home Assistant add-on that scans tennis court availability across multiple booking systems (SEB Arena, Baltic Tennis) and surfaces matching slots via the web UI and Home Assistant notifications.

This addon is fully independent of the `investments/` addon — separate `src/`, `public/`, `data/`, Dockerfile, config, and versioning. They share no code.

## Conventions

- Runs as a standalone Home Assistant add-on (amd64, aarch64)
- Web ingress on port 8099
- Persistent data storage at `/data` inside the container
- Supervisor API access for Home Assistant notifications
- Build pipeline: esbuild bundles backend to `dist/bundle.cjs` and frontend to content-hashed `public/app-[HASH].{js,css}` assets; server discovers the hashed filenames at startup

## Court Availability Monitoring

- **Automatic polling** with configurable interval (10–3600 seconds, default 30s)
- **Night hours** — separate interval (23:00–08:00) to reduce polling during off-hours
- **Multi-provider support** — query multiple tennis court systems simultaneously
- **Date scanning** — scan specific dates or automatically check the next 7 days
- **Time preferences** — filter by earliest start time and latest end time
- **Duration filtering** — minimum booking duration (30–180 minutes)
- **Slot merging** — consecutive 30-minute slots merged into continuous blocks

## Providers

### SEB Arena

- Queries the Teniso Pasaulis API for court availability
- Session token authentication
- Fetches court name, surface type, price, and slot status
- Retrieves user's existing bookings (next 6 months) with pricing

### Baltic Tennis

- Scrapes the Baltic Tennis booking portal
- Username/password authentication with automatic session renewal
- Parses Lithuanian calendar format
- Retrieves user's upcoming bookings with price and duration

### Provider Management

- Enable/disable providers independently for radar polling — credentials remain active for bookings even when a provider is excluded from the radar
- Automatic disabling after persistent failures (10 consecutive errors)
- One-click resume for all disabled providers
- Concurrent fetching across providers

## Notifications

- **Home Assistant persistent notifications** in the HA notification panel
- **Mobile push notifications** to a configured device with action buttons (Open Booking Site / Dismiss)
- **Deduplication** — suppresses duplicate alerts for the same slot within 1 hour
- **Error alerts** when a provider is disabled due to failures
- **Booking reminders** — automatic reminders at 72 hours (3 days) and 49 hours before each existing booking. Bookings are fetched from providers every 6 hours and cached in memory; a lightweight in-memory tick re-evaluates the cache every 30 minutes so threshold crossings fire promptly without re-hitting the network. Each `(booking, threshold)` fires at most once with state persisted to `/data/booking-reminders.json` so restarts don't resend. If the addon comes online late, only the most-imminent applicable threshold fires.

## Web UI

Single-page application with persistent sidebar (desktop, 220px) and bottom tab bar (mobile). Warm dark theme, amber/gold accent, DM Sans typography, JetBrains Mono for numeric data.

Navigation: **Tennis Radar** (Courts, Bookings) + **Settings**.

### Courts Screen
- Available slots grouped by date with cards showing court name, time range, duration, provider
- Summary of total matching courts
- Poll statistics: last poll time, dates checked, slots found, query duration, per-provider breakdown

### Bookings Screen
- User's existing bookings from all providers with configured credentials, grouped by date — bookings are returned regardless of whether the provider is enabled for radar polling
- Back-to-back bookings on the same court (where one ends exactly when the next begins) are merged into a single combined session — duration is summed and price is summed when the format is parseable
- Court name, time, duration, provider, price, status
- Manual refresh button, error handling for fetch failures

### Settings Screen
- **Date picker** — select from next 14 days with weekend indicators (accent-bordered card)
- **General** — poll interval, start/end time, min duration, notify device
- **Provider cards** — SEB Arena and Baltic Tennis with always-visible Enabled toggle in the card header; credential fields shown when enabled
- **Advanced card** — always-visible Debug mode toggle
- Save with immediate effect and validation feedback (sticky bottom bar with backdrop blur)

### Status & Errors
- Status badge in sidebar: Running / Issues / Error / Loading
- Configuration warnings (invalid times, missing credentials, no providers enabled)
- Provider error banner with details and resume button

## Resilience

- Exponential backoff on polling failures (max 5 minutes)
- Provider isolation — one failure doesn't affect others
- Automatic session reconnection (Baltic Tennis)
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT

## Configuration

- Persistent config stored in `/data/config.json`
- Falls back to HA add-on options, then defaults
- Validates settings and returns warnings to UI
- Legacy key migration (teniso_pasaulis → seb)

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/status` — polling status, available slots, provider stats, config warnings
- `GET /api/bookings` — user's existing court bookings from all providers
- `GET /api/config`, `POST /api/config` — read/update configuration
- `POST /api/resume` — re-enable disabled providers

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Mantine UI v7, esbuild
- **Backend**: Fastify, Node.js 20+
- **Deployment**: Docker (Alpine Linux), s6-overlay, port 8099
- **Design tokens**: DM Sans + JetBrains Mono, warm dark theme, amber/gold accent, CSS custom properties
- **Cache control**: all responses include no-cache headers; content-hashed bundle filenames (`app-[HASH].js`) ensure fresh assets after deploys
